      q1: "What is Sharetribe?"
      a1: "Sharetribe is a network of “tribes”, online communities where you can share goods, services, rides and spaces in a local, trusted environment. You can create a tribe for free for your university campus, your company, your neighborhood, your association, your sports club or your congregation, you name it!"
      q2: "What can you share in Sharetribe?"
      a2: "Pretty much anything you want! Some examples: you can sell, swap, or give away stuff you don’t need any more, like old clothers, books, dvds, furniture or children’s toys. You can rent out or lend goods you don’t want to get rid off but don’t use every day like tools, sports equipment or musical instruments. You can share a ride to work or form a car pooling ring to take your kids to soccer practice. You can help others out in various ways using your time, skills and knowledge: taking a neighbor’s dog to a walk, helping a colleague with computer issues, drilling a hole in your fellow student’s wall. Or you can rent out your flat or your couch to others, temporarily or for good. You can ask money for your goods and services or give things away for free."
      q3: "Why Sharetribe?"
      a3: "Life is better when you share. By sharing your physical assets - goods, services, rides and spaces - you can make money, save the environment, and connect with the people around you. In today’s world, sharing is still not yet easy enough to really become part of the mainstream culture. We are set out to change that by making sharing easy, fun and cool. "
      q4: "Why many tribes instead of a single global community?"
      a4: "Two reasons: location and trust. Sharing physical assets is very local. It happens in your immediate environment. With local tribes, it’s easier to see what’s around you. And trust is a key thing to make sharing easier. Trusting strangers is difficult, so we think it’s good to start by sharing with people you already have a connection with: your colleagues, fellow students or neighbors."
      q5: "Who is behind Sharetribe?"
      a5: "Sharetribe Ltd is a social for-profit enterprise registered in Finland. Our mission is to help people connect with their community and to help eliminate excess waste by making it easier for everyone to use our assets more effectively by sharing them. You can read more about our team and our philosophy <a href=\"http://avoinyritys.fi/english\">here</a> or contact CEO Juho Makkonen (<a href=\"mailto:juho@sharetribe.com\">juho@sharetribe.com</a>) or CTO Antti Virolainen (<a href=\"mailto:antti@sharetribe.com\">antti@sharetribe.com</a>)."
      q6: "How can I start a new tribe in my neighborhood/university/workplace etc?"
      a6: "All you need to do is click this %{new_tribe_link}! Follow the directions to create your own tribe. It's completely free!"
      q7: "Is it safe to lend my items to people I don't know before?"
      a7: "In Sharetribe you will be in contact with people who are in the same tribes as you. You might be in the same office, live on the same street or share a math class together. Still, you can never fully trust someone you don't know. Use common sense when you are in contact with people through Sharetribe. If you meet someone for the first time, do it in a public place. Check what kind of reviews people have given the user in the past from their Sharetribe profile. When you are smart about your property and contact details sharing can be a rewarding experience for everyone."
      q8: "Where is Sharetribe used already?"
      a8: "Sharetribe is being used in hundreds of communities %{tribes_map_link}, with new communities getting opened all the time. Universities, companies, congregations, neighborhood communities, sports teams and all sorts of other communities use Sharetribe for sharing all around the world."
      q9: "Can I get Sharetribe in my own language?"
      a9: "Sharetribe is currently available, among others, in English, Spanish, Finnish, Greek, French, Russian and German, and will be translated into more languages in the future. You can check the %{translations_link}. If you need Sharetribe in a particular language or would like to help us translate our service send us an e-mail at language@sharetribe.com!"
      q10: "Is Sharetribe Open Source?"
      a10: "Yes. Sharetribe is licensed on a free MIT license. You can download the code from %{github_link} and use it any way you will. Please contact us if you have any questions related to developing on top of Sharetribe code.</p><p>Our vision is to develop the best platform for local resource sharing and we believe that the best way to achieve this goal is to open the source and make it possible for interested developer to add new customizations to the code and thus make Sharetribe a more versatile tool for different sharing needs. The developer community is still very young, but we encourage you to join and share your work. Or if you just want to get the code and install a Sharetribe server for free, that's ok too."
      q11: "Can I modify the look and feel of my tribe?"
      a11: "We offer extensive customization options to match the needs of your community. You can add the slogan, description and a possible logo and change the color scheme to match the look & feel of your community. It's also possible to modify the default listing categories."
      q12: "How much does Sharetribe cost?"
      a12: "The basic version of Sharetribe is completely free for your community. If you represent a bigger organization, like a university or a company, and need things like integration to your intranet, custom features or extensive support, <a href=\"mailto:sales@sharetribe.com\">be in touch</a> and let us know what you need, and we'll make you an offer."
