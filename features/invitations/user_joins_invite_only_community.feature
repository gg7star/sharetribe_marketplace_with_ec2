Feature: User joins invite only community
  In order to maintain trust in closed community
  As a community administrator
  I want that new users can join only if they have valid invite code

  @javascript
  Scenario: User has valid invite code
    Given there are following users:
      | person |
      | kassi_testperson1 |
    And community "test" requires invite to join
    And I am not logged in
    And I am on the signup page
    And there is an invitation for community "test" with code "GH1JX8"
    When I fill in "Invitation code" with "GH1JX8"
    And I remove the focus
    And I fill in "person[username]" with random username
    And I fill in "First name" with "Testmanno"
    And I fill in "Last name" with "Namez"
    And I fill in "person_password1" with "test"
    And I fill in "Confirm password" with "test"
    And I fill in "Email address" with random email
    And I check "person_terms"
    And I press "Create account"
    Then I should not see "The invitation code is not valid."
    And I should not see "This field is required."
    And Most recently created user should be member of "test" community with status "pending_email_confirmation" and its latest consent accepted with invitation code "GH1JX8"
    And Invitation with code "GH1JX8" should have 0 usages_left

  @javascript
  Scenario: User tries to register without valid invite code
    Given there are following users:
      | person |
      | kassi_testperson1 |
    And community "test" requires invite to join
    And I am not logged in
    And I am on the signup page
    And I fill in "person[username]" with random username
    And I fill in "First name" with "Testmanno"
    And I fill in "Last name" with "Namez"
    And I fill in "person_password1" with "test"
    And I fill in "Confirm password" with "test"
    And I fill in "Email address" with random email
    And I check "person_terms"
    And I press "Create account"
    Then I should see "This field is required."

  @javascript

  @javascript
  Scenario: User should not see invitation code in the form, if it's not needed
    Given I am not logged in
    And community "test" does not require invite to join
    And I am on the signup page
    Then I should not see "Invitation code"
    Given community "test" requires invite to join

    And I should not see "This field is required."
    And I should see "Please confirm your email"
    And I should receive 1 email

    And I follow "confirmation" in the email
    Then I should see "The email you entered is now confirmed"
    And I should have 2 emails
    And Most recently created user should be member of "test" community with its latest consent accepted with invitation code "GH1JX8"
